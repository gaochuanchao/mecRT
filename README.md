# mecRT: Mobile Edge Computing Simulator for Real-Time Applications  

**mecRT** is an open-source simulator for **Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)** scenarios (previously known as vecSim - vehicular edge computing simulator). It provides a comprehensive framework for modeling **task offloading** and **resource allocation** in heterogeneous 5G-enabled environments. By integrating realistic wireless communication (via **Simu5G**) with edge computing models, mecRT enables researchers to evaluate scheduling strategies for latency-sensitive applications under resource and deadline constraints.

## üîç Why mecRT?  

Existing MEC simulators have limitations:  

- **iFogSim / EdgeCloudSim**: Good for resource modeling, but **lack 5G network support** and cannot capture real-time channel quality feedback.  
- **Simu5G / Fogbed**: Offer fine-grained 5G network modeling, but **do not support integrated offloading frameworks** that jointly optimize bandwidth and computational resources under deadline constraints.  

**mecRT bridges this gap** by combining realistic **5G-based communication** with a **deadline-aware scheduling framework**. This enables evaluation of adaptive offloading strategies in dynamic MEC environments.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture  

A typical mecRT environment consists of:  

- **User Equipments (UEs)** that offload tasks to nearby **Edge Servers (ESs)** via 5G links.  
- **Edge Servers** providing both wireless bandwidth and computational resources.  
- A centralized **Scheduler** that monitors system state and periodically decides offloading and allocation.  

mecRT extends Simu5G with:  
- Online control logic for bandwidth reallocation and suspension under poor channel conditions.  
- Deadline-aware resource allocation for real-time MEC applications.
