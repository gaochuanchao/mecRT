## Issues Pending to solve

### 1. MecOspf Module
- [x] the hello and lsa packet has print errors in ipv4 module in the gui mode, but works fine in cmdenv mode, this issue will cause a core dump when we close the GUI window during ospf synchronization, consider to move it to the application layer in the future. So far, it does not influence the experiments in Cmdenv mode.
